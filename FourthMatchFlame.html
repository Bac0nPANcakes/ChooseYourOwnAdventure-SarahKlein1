    The door slams shut behind you, seeingly trying to make sure that the abnormality doesn't have the slightest chance
    of running away. The room smells strongly of smoke and as you look around, you can't find the abnormality. That is,
    until you look down and spot a small child made of ash. The girl is impaled in the torso by a large burning
    matchstick, but she doesn't seem to be bothered by it. She hides in the corner, seemingly afraid of you, but
    something in her eyes tells you that she isn't as peaceful as she seems. </p>

  <h2>What will you do?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Feed the child some snacks you found stashed on a shelf in the unit</li>
    <li>Sweep up the ash in the room</li>
    <li>
      <a href="FourthMatchFlameAttachment.html" target:_blank> Try and talk to the kid. She's gotta be lonely since
        she's locked in this room all day</a>
    </li>
    <li> <a href="FourthMatchFlameRepression.html" target:_blank> Grab a fire extinguisher and put out her fire </a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- after her fire gets extinguished in repression work, she just pouts in the corner, crying a bit more than usual lmao.

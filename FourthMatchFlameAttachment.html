  <h2>
    F-01-02
    <br>
    You try to talk with the kid
  </h2>

  <p>You approach the kid in the corner, crouching down to avoid scaring her.</p>
  <p>"Heya kiddo. How are you doing?" you ask, speaking softly.</p>
  <p>The scorched girl just glares at you in response.</p>
  <p>"C'mon, no need to be so grouchy~ Let's just have a little chat. Say, does that match in your chest hurt? Want me
    to take it out?"</p>
  <p>She holds on to the match like it's the one thing that's keeping her happy. Her eyes glow red as the fire on the
    matchstick flares up. The heat stings and you can feel your skin starting to burn.</p>
  <p>"Chill out kiddo. It was just a question. Why do you even want it anyway? It's just a flaming stick that doesn't go
    out for some reason."</p>
  <p>She did <b>not</b> like what you said. She stands up, ashen hands balled into fists. Eyes glowing firey red,
    matchstick burning away, she walks towards you, her glare being one of pure hatred.</p>

  <p>"This match is my only hope left. If I'm going to perish, I'll make you meet the same fate. You'll be reduced to
    ashes like me."</p>

  <!-- have two options. one for running (she catches up and kills you lmao) and another for staying there confused (cue girl exploding like a cubic meter of TNT) -->
  <p>As she slowly approaches you, you are filled with pure unbridled dread.</p>

  <h2>What will you do?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="FourthMatchFlameAttachmentRun.html" target:_blank>
        Run for your life </a>
    </li>
    <li> <a href="FourthMatchFlameAttachmentStay.html" target:_blank> Stand still and wait to see what happens</a> </li>

  </ul>

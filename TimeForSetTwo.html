  <h2>
    You didn't die a horrible, painful death!
  </h2>
  <p>
    You survived your first encounters with the Abnormalities that are held within this facility. However, there's more
    energy to be collected and more work to be done. Since you can be trusted to handle the weaker Abnormalities, you're
    told to put your skills to the test on some more dangerous ones that are in the department below yours. Leaving the
    brown department you were in, you head down the elevator into a department in shades of rich purple. At least,
    that's what you think it is. It's hard to know for sure in the darkness. You wander into a hallway with another 3
    units. How much more deadly are these monsters? Will they kill you on the spot? Will your corpse be used as a puppet
    by the creature? Well, those monsters won't work on themselves, so you decide to press on and select which eldrich
    monstrosity will get the chance to slaughter you first.
  </p>
  <h2>Which unit will you enter?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>F-01-69</li>

    <li>O-02-56</li> <!-- best smol bird -->

    <li>T-05-51</li> <!-- Carmen moment lmao -->

  </ul>

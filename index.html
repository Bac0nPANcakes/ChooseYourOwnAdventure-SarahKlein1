  <!-- Special thanks to the people who made the Lobotomy Corporation and Library of Ruina fan wiki pages. They were a massive help in getting facts about the abnormalities right and not just relying solely on memory.
  Also special thanks to Project Moon for creating Lobotomy Corporation and Library of Ruina. These games are incredible and have been my hyperfixation for the past 5ish years.
  That's enough rambling from me. Enjoy the thingy and have fun! -->

  <h1>
    Can you survive Lobotomy Corporation?
  </h1>
  <h2>You are a new agent at Lobotomy Corporation. Things are going fine until the power suddenly cuts out.
    <br>Strange creatures known as Abnormalities are wandering the halls. Screams echo throughout the facility.
    <br>Can you survive until the lights turn back on or will you be yet another corpse littering the floor?

  </h2>

  <p>
    You hear from someone that the only way to turn the lights back on is to interact with those Abnormalities that fill
    the facility. Many of them are deadly and can kill you in seconds, others make your body a host for some cruel
    infection, disease, or parasite, and others are horrible enough to drive you mad at a glance. A higher up shouts at
    you to get moving and get to work.
  </p>

  <p>In this hall there are 3 containment units. All of the doors are shut tight and you can't tell what's within. This
    department is home to some of the weaker Abnormalities. However, this doesn't mean that they aren't dangerous.</p>

  <h2>Which unit will you enter?</h2>

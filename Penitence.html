    Unlike the other containment unit doors, this one closes gently, as if the monster inside poses no threat to anyone. Inside the unit there is a large levitating cross with a skull wearing a crown of thorns melded to it. It floats roughly 2 meters above the floor. You can faintly hear angelic chanting reverberate through the room. Despite not seeming like it's sentient, you get the feeling that it's judging you for your sins.

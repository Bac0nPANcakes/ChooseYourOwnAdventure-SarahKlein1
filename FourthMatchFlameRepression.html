  <h2>You decide to put out the fire</h2>

  <p>Grabbing the fire extinguisher from the wall, you spray the girl down, extinguishing her matchstick. Upon realizing
    that her fire is out, she starts crying and sits in the corner furthest away from you. She looks like you took away
    the only thing that was keeping her happy. You try to apologize, feeling bad for the child, but her eyes just glow
    red as she gives you a death glare. The match impaling her has flared up again, burning away the stick brightly as
    she slowly stomps over to you. You back away, scared of her wrath and what will happen once she gets to you. Upon
    seeing you back off, she just sits down and keeps pouting. Your skin burns from the heat of the room, but you're
    relatively fine. You're gonna want to do something about those burns though. They hurt quite a bit.</p>

  <p>Leaving the unit, you're told to work on the two other abnormalities in the hall. Taking a moment to pull yourself
    together, you mull over your options.</p>

  <h2>Which will you choose?</h2>

    Hearing the containment unit shut, you look around and spot two shrimp people (?) wearing blue-gray overalls and yellow boots guarding a flashy grey vending machine. Apparently the soda the machine dispenses is free if the advertisements are to be believed. The room smells of soda and sea salt and it looks like salt water had dried on the walls and the sides of the soda machine. How did that much salt water make it into the room? You decide not to think about it too much and get to work on the abnormality. The shrimps' beady eyes seem to stare into your soul as they wait for you to make the first move.

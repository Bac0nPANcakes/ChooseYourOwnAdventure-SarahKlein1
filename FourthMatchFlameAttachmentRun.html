		You run. As fast as you can.
  </h2>

<p>You sprint towards the door and it opens automatically. But it doesn't shut, letting the Abnormality out as well. You dash away from the girl and towards the nearest group of people. They look at you in confusion, before realizing why you're running.</p> 
  <p>Scorched Girl has breached containment.</p>
<p>They note who the girl is targeting and look at you in pity. One of them presses a button and the door at the end of the hallway slams shut just before you reach it, trapping you in the hall with the Abnormality. You turn around and the girl is still slowly walking towards you. There is nothing of that little girl left, only hatred. Your knees start to wobble as she approaches, your fear becoming almost unbearable. Suddenly, she lunges at you and clings on tightly, her match burning away brightly. In the fire you see images of a christmas tree glittering in the light, a feast full of warm food, a warm fireplace, and an old lady who's reading stories to the scorched girl sitting on her lap. The fourth match's flame fills you with enough joy to fight back the freezing winter. As long as that match doesn't go out, the cold doesn't matter.</p>

<p>"I wonder what I'll see when you burn away as well..."</p>

<p>The match impaled in her torso burns faster and once there's nothing left to burn she explodes like a cubic meter of TNT. The parts of you that survived the explosion are now painting the walls, floor and ceiling, still smoking from the fire.</p>
  <p>At least your final moments were happy.</p>

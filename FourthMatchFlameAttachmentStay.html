		You decide to stay and see what the girl is going to do.
  </h2>
	<p>She glares at you, slowly walking towards you. There is nothing of that little girl left, only hatred. Your knees start to wobble as she approaches, your fear becoming almost unbearable. Suddenly, she lunges at you and clings on tightly, her match burning away brightly. In the fire you see images of a christmas tree glittering in the light, a feast full of warm food, a warm fireplace, and an old lady who's reading stories to the scorched girl sitting on her lap. The fourth match's flame fills you with enough joy to fight back the freezing winter. As long as that match doesn't go out, the cold doesn't matter.</p>

<p>"I wonder what I'll see when you burn away as well..."</p>

<p>The match impaled in her torso burns faster and once there's nothing left to burn she explodes like a cubic meter of TNT. The parts of you that survived the explosion are now painting the walls, floor and ceiling, still smoking from the fire.</p>
  <p>At least your final moments were happy.</p>
